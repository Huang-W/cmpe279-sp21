## CMPE 279 - SW Security Techs

#### Programming Assignment 1

In this assignment, the parent and child processes share the same local variables.

A fork is done after the privileged binding of port 80.

The parent process waits for the child process to exit, while the child blocks until a connection is present.

The child lowers its privilege using a passwd entry with name of 'nobody'.
